        //We are also able to create objects using constructor functions.

        //A constructor function is given a capitalized name to make it clear that it is a constructor.

        //Here's an example of a constructor function:

        var Car = function () {
            this.wheels = 4;
            this.engines = 1;
            this.seats = 5;
        };

        //In a constructor the this variable refers to the new object being created by the constructor.So when we write,

        this.wheels = 4;

        //inside of the constructor we are giving the new object it creates a property called wheels with a value of 4.

        //You can think of a constructor as a description for the object it will create.

        //Now let's put that great constructor function we made in the last lesson to use!

        //To use a constructor function we call it with the new keyword in front of it like:

        var myCar = new Car();

        //myCar is now an instance of the Car constructor that looks like the object it described:

        {
            wheels: 4,
                engines: 1,
                    seats: 5
        }
        //Note that it is important to use the new keyword when calling a constructor.This is how Javascript knows to create a new object and that all the references to this inside the constructor should be referring to this new object.

        //Now, once the myCar instance is created it can be used like any other object and can have its properties accessed and modified the same way you would usually.For example:

        myCar.turboType = "twin";

        //Our myCar variable now has a property turboType with a value of "twin".



        //The constructor we have is great, but what if we don't always want to create the same object?

        // To solve this we can add parameters to our constructor.We do this like the following example:

        var Car = function (wheels, seats, engines) {
            this.wheels = wheels;
            this.seats = seats;
            this.engines = engines;
        };
        //Now we can pass in arguments when we call our constructor.

        var myCar = new Car(6, 3, 1);

        //This code will create an object that uses the arguments we passed in and looks like:

        {
            wheels: 6,
                seats: 3,
                    engines: 1
        }
